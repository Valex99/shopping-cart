- Add different fonts (Releway font)
- Add new arrivals Component!

FeaturedCollection:
- Fix lateral padding (resize of images when screen goes towards 700px)
- Add media query at around 700 / 800px page width
- Fix side padding (apply max width)
- Fix link to see collection - works if you click right when text ends...

Footer:
- Fix footer - section should be tighter together

Grid:
- Fix resizing
- Fix gap between products on page resize

Bug:
- Items in the cart are not upadting if you refresh the page and the product is a copy of the original fetched product
- Once the data is fetched withing the context (triplicate it there) and you dont need another file to do so
- TLDR; Data should be fetched on page load and only inside WatchesContext -> it should be exported from there! - Adjust the logic in ProductGrid.jsx
